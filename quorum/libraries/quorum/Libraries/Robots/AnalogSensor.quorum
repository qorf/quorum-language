/*
The Analog Sensor class represents a physical analog sensor. Each senor has a 
designation, an integer, that says which port it is connected to(e.g., 0 to 7). 
The analog sensor can be used only after it is connected to a port. Once the 
sensor is connected to a port, we can read the analog value from the sensor and 
set the sensor to floating value.
 
Attribute: Example

use Libraries.Robots.AnalogSensor

// Declaraing an analog sensor    
AnalogSensor analog
// Set connection with the analog sensor connected to port 4
analog:SetPort(4)
integer analog = analog:GetValue()
if analog > 512
    print "Sensor detects a light color"
else
    print "Sensor detects a dark color"
end

        This action connects the sensor to the specified analog port. After the 
        sensor is connected to the port, we can read the values from the sensor.

        Attribute: Parameter port to which we intend to connect the analog sensor 
        to. Port values vary from 0 to 7.

        Attribute: Example
        
        AnalogSensor analog
        analog:SetPort(6)

        This action returns the port to which the sensor is connected to.

        This action sets the analog sensor to a floating point, i.e. it resets
        the analog sensor.
        Please note that all sensor ports are set to non-floating when the 
        controller is rebooted or when a program exits. So in order to set the 
        sensor to floating we need to use this action.

        Attribute: Example
        
        AnalogSensor analog
        analog:SetPort(0)
        analog:Reset()
        //Analog sensor connected to port 0 is set to floating

    /*
        This action returns the approximate distance of the object using SONAR. 
        SONAR stands for SOund Navigation And Ranging. The SONAR sensor works by 
        sending out a burst of ultrasonic sound (a ping) and measuring the amount 
        of time it takes to hear the echo. Then the sensor divides that time by 
        the speed of sound and returns a distance.

        Attribute: Returns the object distance in millimeter.
        
        Attribute: Example
        
        AnalogSensor analog
        analog:SetPort()

        integer distance = analog:GetDistance()

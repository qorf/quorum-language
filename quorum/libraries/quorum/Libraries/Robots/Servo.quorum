/*
The Servo class represents a physical servo. 
Each servo has a designation, 
an integer, that says which port this servo is connected to (e.g., 0, 1, 2 or 3). 
In order to use a servo we need to set connection with the servo first and then 
use the servo for other operations. A standard servo has a range of about 
180 degrees and 2048 positions in that range it can be set to. When you first set 
connection to the servo using SetPort(), if we have not specified a position, 
all servos will go to the middle position (1024). After setting a servo position, 
the program needs to wait for the servo to get to the desired position. Servos 
are typically used in arms, or claws of the robot that require high precision. 


Attribute: Example

use Libraries.Robots.Servo

// Declaraing the servo
Servo servo
// Set connection with the servo connected to port 1
servo:SetPort(1)
// Move the servo to position 2000
servo:MoveToPosition(2000)
// Switch off the servo 
servo:Off()

        Attribute: Example

        This action moves the servo to the specified position.
        The value of pos must be in the range 0 to 2047
        Servo has mechanical stops at 0 and 180 degrees, sometimes it is possible 
        to “overdrive” a servo. This means the mechanical stops are preventing 
        the servo from reaching the desired position. 
        Overdriving causes the servo to buzz or hum and can cause permanent 
        damage to the servo.

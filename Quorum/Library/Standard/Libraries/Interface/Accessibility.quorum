/*
    Accessibility is a class designed to encapsulate accessibility concepts across all operating systems, 
    inside of the graphics and user interface system. Accessibility systems are not the same everywhere, 
    including on Windows (UIA), Mac (NSAccessibility), or the web, and as such each platform or operating 
    environment must implement its own Accessibility sub-class.

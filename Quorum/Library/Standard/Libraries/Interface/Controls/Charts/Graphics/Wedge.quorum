/*
The Wedge class is used to render wedges in a pie chart. Wedges have an outer radius that measures
the number of pixels from the origin (the center of a pie chart) to the outer edge of the wedge.
They also have an inner radius that measures how many pixels are between the origin and the start
of the wedge, allowing for "donut" style charts.

A wedge should always be the same size as its parent container. If it doesn't have a parent, the
wedge should be large enough to render the whole circle, even if it's only a portion of it.

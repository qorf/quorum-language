/*
The Serial class is used to connect to and communicate over a serial connection.
Communication includes reading and writing to a specified serial port. Connections
using Serial can only be made over serial connections (e.g. Standard Serial over
Bluetooth Link with paired Bluetooth devices or USB Serial Device).

A Serial object is initialized with no assigned serial port when instantiated.
Assigning a serial port to a Serial object can be done with the action Connect.
Reading and writing to the serial connection can be handled by the actions Read
and Send, respectively. Connections should be closed with the action Close when
no longer in use.

//This was tested using virtual serial ports with pseudo terminals on Linux:
//  socat -d -d pty,raw,echo=0 pty,raw,echo=0
//Then, using the two ports returned by that command (e.g /dev/pts/1 and /dev/pts/2)
//as the ports for Connect with two separate instances of this program, both instances
//sent and received the hello message.
